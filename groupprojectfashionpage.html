        <div class="title2"> What is Eco-Friendly Fashion?</div>
        <div class="text1">Eco-friendly fashion is the concept of sustainable fashion, and being a conscious consumer when it comes to clothing choices. Currently, it is a social movement that aims to lower the environmental impacts that the clothing industry creates, due to excessive waste, carbon emissions, and overall pollution.</div>

    <div class="Text2">A major aspect of eco-friendly clothing is avoiding fast fashion- items that are based on the micro-trends of the internet, as the fashion cycle is so quick in recent times, that items come and go out of trend within months, meaning that lower-quality items are being mass produced from fast fashion companies in order to meet the trend-based demand, creating excessive, and unnecessary waste.</div>

    <div class="Text3">To create a more eco-friendly wardrobe, you can start small, and work your way up, as drastic changes are unrealistic for the majority of people. To begin with, if the actual items being shopped for are difficult to change, you can try deliveries that are more carbon-neutral and use eco-friendly packaging with minimal waste. Along with this, you can try to avoid one-time use packaging, and try sharing shipping items to reduce the amount of packaging used.</div>

    </div>
    
    <div class="text4container">
     <div class="Text4">In terms of the clothing, many changes can be made. To start small, you can implement practices of thrifting and repurposing clothes by having them tailored, or alter them yourself. Along with this, more clothing rental services can be implemented to reduce the number of wasted or forgotten clothing items sitting in people’s closets, and could potentially be cheaper than simply buying an item, especially with more formal or high-end attire. In terms of new purchases, consumers should be more mindful to buy items they genuinely like and will wear multiple times, rather than buying low-quality, fast-fashion, trend-cycle based items, to ensure materials are not being wasted. Along with this, investing in items from eco-friendly fashion companies is key, as mass interest will drive away profits from cheaper brands, allowing eco-friendly fashion to become more common and financially accessible overtime, whilst helping the environment. The eco-friendly fashion space can be approached in a plethora of ways, but what truly matters is that people simply make a change, whether big or small, because every change counts, and every action matters.</div>
