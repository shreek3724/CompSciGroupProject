        <div class="title2"> What is Eco-Friendly Construction?</div>
        <div class="text1">Eco-friendly construction, also known as green building, is the practice of building structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient. Eco-friendly construction can help reduce the negative impact of buildings on the environment and natural resources.</div>
        <div class="title3">Materials</div>
        <div class="Text3">Eco-friendly construction involves using sustainable materials and methods to reduce the environmental impact of building projects. Here are some examples of eco-friendly construction materials:
            Cob, recycled steel, sheep’s wool, reclaimed, recycled or sustainable wood, cork, straw bales, bamboo, recycled plastic, ashcrete, ferrock, hempcrete, plant-based polyurethane rigid foam, enviroboard, mycelium, clay brick, timbercrete, recycled rubber, stone, laminated timber, precast concrete, cordwood, recycled glass, rammed earth, adobe, low-VOC paints and finishes, etc.</div>

        <!-- <div class="Text2">A major aspect of eco-friendly clothing is avoiding fast fashion- items that are based on the micro-trends of the internet, as the fashion cycle is so quick in recent times, that items come and go out of trend within months, meaning that lower-quality items are being mass produced from fast fashion companies in order to meet the trend-based demand, creating excessive, and unnecessary waste.</div> -->
        <div class="image3"></div>
       <!--  <div class="Text4">In terms of the clothing, many changes can be made. To start small, you can implement practices of thrifting and repurposing clothes by having them tailored, or alter them yourself. Along with this, more clothing rental services can be implemented to reduce the number of wasted or forgotten clothing items sitting in people’s closets, and could potentially be cheaper than simply buying an item, especially with more formal or high-end attire. In terms of new purchases, consumers should be more mindful to buy items they genuinely like and will wear multiple times, rather than buying low-quality, fast-fashion, trend-cycle based items, to ensure materials are not being wasted. Along with this, investing in items from eco-friendly fashion companies is key, as mass interest will drive away profits from cheaper brands, allowing eco-friendly fashion to become more common and financially accessible overtime, whilst helping the environment. The eco-friendly fashion space can be approached in a plethora of ways, but what truly matters is that people simply make a change, whether big or small, because every change counts, and every action matters.</div> -->
